After starting The Odin Project I quickly got hooked and dove down the rabbit hole and decided to go ahead and see what I could do with the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've built this dietary calculator only using very basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript so I'm sure there are much more effecient ways to get the same functionality, but I wanted to see if I could create an idea that I had in my head using the basics; turns out I could!
